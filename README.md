GUI for OANDA's API javascript wrapper

This is a demo of what can be done using oanda.js. It copies some of the functionalities from the Java GUI. An account ID
is set by default each time the page is loaded, but a new one can be generated to test around with. The list of instruments
displayed can be changed by clicking on "Select Pairs", and pairs that the account has an open trade or order with will
automatically be displayed. Clicking on modifiable fields in the trades or orders list will allow you to input a new value
and modify that trade or order. Transactions List has not been implemented. Lastly, the candlestick chart only supports
changing instruments for now.
